The Zeitgeist Movement Defined
==============================

This is my attempt to set the original text as found under

http://www.thezeitgeistmovement.com/orientation

into LaTex. At the same time i am going through the whole text, trying
to smooth out various stylistic inconsistencies. In particular in

* reference style of web links: "(url)" vs "Source: (url)" vs "Ref:
  (url)" 
* references of peer reviewed articles, books, online articles,
  websites 
* emphasis within text: italics vs 'single quotes' vs [brackets] vs
  "double quotes"


Current style guide
===================

* bibTeX is used for all references (websites, online articles, books,
  scientific papers)
* all references are cited within the text and are given in a
  bibliography at the end of the document
* footnotes are reserved for actual text footnotes
* actual textquotes of other authors is quoted within double quotes


Conversion process
==================

Right now the conversion process is a bit slow. I ran *html2latex*
converter on the above orientation web site. Next, I created the
backbone of a LaTeX book class document and included all the chapters.
Then copied each paragraph of the source into a LaTeX document,
checking references, style, quotes, emphasis' along the way.
